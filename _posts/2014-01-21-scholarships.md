<h4>National Scholarship Schemes</h4>
Coláiste UISCE – Irelands No. 1 Irish College, is offering €1000’s worth of scholarships to students around the country. The scholarship applies to selected courses from our Gaeltacht Coláiste courses.

Unique to Coláiste UISCE in the heart of the Mayo’s Gaeltacht you will also receive nationally recognised certificates in the various water sports and partake in Climbing, Archery and Team Challenges. This will give students an opportunity to learn Irish in a fun and adventurous environment.

The winners will have an unforgettable experience with a renewed vigour for the Irish Language.

Our monthly draws consist on full and part scholarships.
