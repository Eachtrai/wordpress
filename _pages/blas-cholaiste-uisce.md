<h1>Resource Pack</h1>
We have posted a resource pack to your home address with the following contents:

1. <strong>Course Workbook</strong> – This is a workbook which we have put together to help you prepare for your online classes and activities. A copy of this booklet is available for download at the bottom of the page.

2. <strong>Words and Terms booklet</strong> – Our <strong>‘Cúpla Focal Fiúntach’</strong> booklet gives you the phrases and vocabulary to which we will be referring during the course. A copy of this booklet is available for download at the bottom of the page.

3. <strong>MEAS wrist band</strong> – We have enclosed a MEAS wristband especially for you. MEAS means respect and is a major part of our ethos in Coláiste UISCE. We have incorporated this principle into our online class rules which are outlined on page 4 of the course workbook. We are hoping that you will be happy to abide by our MEAS principles during your classes.

4. <strong>3 x Balloons and bags</strong> – These are required in order to prepare for class 3 – our online juggling class. We would like you to watch our video on how to make homemade juggling balls and to do this as a project prior to class 3. Alternatively, you can use 3 oranges or 3 tennis balls for this class.

5. <strong>Hoodie</strong> – Finally, you will receive your own 2020 special edition Coláiste UISCE hoodie. To show support for everyone who is working hard to prevent the spread of Covid 19 we have put the words ‘<strong>Ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine</strong>’ on the hoodie which means ‘<strong>We all depend on each other</strong>’.Please continue to do your best to stop the spread of Covid 19 and wear it with pride<strong> - You've earned it!
</strong>
<h1>Additional Course Videos</h1>
By clicking on the link at the bottom of this page you will have access to 5 additional class videos. These short videos compliment the work done during the classes and set out easy tasks which can be done “As Gaeilge” in order to consolidate the learning achieved in the classes. This approach is consistent with our philosophy that <strong>task based learning</strong> and a <strong>fun approach</strong> is the best way to learn the Irish language. <em><strong>Bain sult as!</strong></em>

Thank you once again for taking part in our online course. We are really looking forward to sharing a <em>blas</em> of Coláiste UISCE with you!
