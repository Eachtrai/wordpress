Learning Irish is fun at Coláiste UISCE! We have created an exciting and fun learning environment combining the Irish language with adventure activities in the heart of Mayo's Gaeltacht.
<h4>Coláiste UISCE has three course options available:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Gaeltacht Courses</li>
 	<li>Youth Leadership Training Courses</li>
 	<li>Skills Training</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gaeltacht Courses</h2>
Our long established Gaeltacht Courses have the perfect balance between adventure activities and classroom learning. All levels are catered for on these courses.  During the <a title="Exam Focused" href="https://uisce.ie/index.php/gaeltacht-courses/easter-courses/diansraith/">Diansraith </a>Course students are classed according to their exam year and level of Irish.  On top of daily oral Irish practice we give students who are sitting state examinations the opportunity to sit a mock Irish oral exam.  There is something for everyone at UISCE. Whether you struggle to keep up at school or have been learning Irish since birth we have the perfect course for you. These are available during the Easter mid-term break and the summer months, we welcome students from secondary school on these courses. Our <a title="Student Teachers" href="https://uisce.ie/index.php/gaeltacht-courses/abhair-oidi/">Student Teacher’s Training Course </a>(Ábhair Óidí) which runs during the Easter break is a specialised, interactive course catering for the needs of Irish Primary School teachers in training for both the first and second periods.
<h2>Youth Leadership Training Courses</h2>
We believe greatly in personal development, confidence building and leadership skills
<h4>Our Youth leadership Training programme is divided into 3 levels:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><a title="Level 1 Youth leadership" href="https://uisce.ie/index.php/youth-leadership-level-1/">Level 1 Youth Leadership</a></li>
 	<li><a title="Level 2 Ardchinnirí" href="https://uisce.ie/index.php/ardchinniri-level-2/">Level 2 Ardchinnirí</a></li>
 	<li><a title="Level 3 Maoirseoir Oíche" href="https://uisce.ie/index.php/ardchinniri-sinsearacha-level-3/">Level 3 Maoirseoir Oíche</a></li>
</ul>
These levels are based on progression to the next level and to becoming part of the UISCE team.
<h2>Skills Training</h2>
These skills courses are aimed at students with a high standard of Irish and who wish to excel in sailing, windsurfing and surfing. This is an all day activity course no Irish classes are included, while attending students must strictly adhere to the Irish language rule and general course rules.
