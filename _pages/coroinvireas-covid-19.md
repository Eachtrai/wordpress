We have sent an email to those booked on the course above. Please follow the instructions on the email you would have received.If your booking is for a course after this we request that you wait until we contact you, as we are focusing on working in chronological order and due to government restrictions that are in place, we are currently working from home.

<strong>21/04/2020</strong>

As you may be aware, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht have recently announced a decision to cancel all Summer Gaeltacht courses for 2020 due to the current Covid-19 crisis.

We are obviously extremely disappointed for all the students who have been looking forward so much to attending Coláiste UISCE this year however we accept that this decision was taken in the interest of public health and safety and we are happy to play our part in fighting this pandemic. As the Irish seanfhocal says “Ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine” (We all depend on each other)

Like many businesses our onsite administration office is currently closed as a result of the current government restrictions on non-essential work and travel. Therefore, our staff are working from home. While we will continue to respond to all emails, calls and queries, we may not be able to respond immediately however we are providing up to date information for all our customers on this dedicated covid19 webpage.

Due to the high volume of bookings this year, we will be responding to emails and communicating with all customers in relation to their booking options and refunds on a course by course basis based on the plan below:

Course A    04/5/2020 to 08/5/2020
Course B    11/5/2020 to 15/5/2020
Course C    18/5/2020 to 22/5/2020
Course D    25/5/2020 to 29/5/2020
Course E    02/6/2020 to 06/6/2020
Course F    08/6/2020 to 12/6/2020

We will be starting with those who have a place booked on <strong>Cúrsa A 2020 (31st May – 14th June).</strong> If your booking is for a course after this, we request that you wait until we contact you, as we are focusing on working in chronological order.

During the relevant week listed above, all customers will receive an email with options and instructions regarding the next step including a quick survey in order to assist us deal with your booking. Your cooperation with this is much appreciated.

Also, to help alleviate everyone’s disappointment, we are working on a <strong>Virtual Coláiste UISCE Experience online</strong> called <strong>“Blas UISCE”</strong> as well as a <strong>Special Edition 2020 Coláiste UISCE hoodie</strong>, both of which will be available for purchase soon to all our students who were hoping to attend our courses this Summer.
