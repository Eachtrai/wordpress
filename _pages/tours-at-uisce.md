<p style="text-align: left;">TEACHERS - At  UISCE Your wish is our command!</p>
</blockquote>
We at UISCE understand that bringing students away on a school trip can be hard work for teachers. We aim to make your school tour as hassle-free as possible, from the initial consultation right down to getting the students into bed at night. We will work with you to tailor-make the ideal school trip that suits both your requirements and your budget! Building on our experience and the popularity of our unique activity-based summer Irish College, Coláiste UISCE, we have developed various school packages that can be tailored to suit your exact needs and budget. Your school trip can include:
<ul>
 	<li>Watersports (1:6 ratio)</li>
 	<li>Team Building Challenges</li>
 	<li>Archery and Climbing</li>
 	<li>Gaisce Activities</li>
 	<li>Fun Irish Classes</li>
 	<li>Environmental Education</li>
</ul>
When you consult with our helpful staff you can plan your school tour and decide where you would like the focus to lie. We offer an overnight rate for as little as €60 per student or a daytrip for €46 per student. For every 10 students one teacher is allowed come for free! (Prices based on a group of 15+) Teachers may choose to join your students doing activities during the day and take part at the céilí in the evening or alternatively you can relax, enjoy the peace and quiet of our local Blue Flag beaches and spectacular coastline or you can use your free time to catch up on some of that never ending marking! We have 24 hour supervision for your students as standard.
<h2>The Centre</h2>
UISCE is a unique activity based Gaeltacht adventure centre. UISCE is equipped with 4 classrooms, a large dining hall, an indoor climbing wall, an archery hall, basketball courts and a football pitch. This makes it a perfect venue for a School trip to the Gaeltacht.
<blockquote>UISCE is the perfect location for outdoor activities and environmental education - Perfect for your school trip!</blockquote>
UISCE IS situated on the water’s edge of a blue flag beach in Elly Bay, at the heart of Mayo's Gaeltacht. We are surrounded by spectacular coastline, sea, sand dunes, rugged sea cliffs and unspoilt natural beauty. We have the perfect location to carry out your environmental education field trip. Parts of the Mullet Peninsula are designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) under the EU Habitats Directive, in recognition of the variety of important terrestrial and marine habitats, the number of rare plant and animal species and its proximity to pristine bog lands. In UISCE, we specialise in mixing the enjoyable experience of adventure sports with Gaeilge. This helps students develop a new positive perspective of the Irish language. Once a student changes their attitude towards Gaeilge, learning the language becomes easier. “Learning Irish is fun” is our motto and we now have over 20 years experience in providing safe, professional and enjoyable Irish adventure courses.

<h2>The Gaeltacht Experience!</h2>
You can tailor your School Trip to suit your own requirements. We can fully immerse students in the Irish language or gently introduce them to an atmosphere Gaelach. All watersports, outdoor activities, climbing, evening activities and céilis are on offer through the medium of Irish. We would love to customise a program for your school tour.
<h2>GAISCE Programmes</h2>
UISCE can offer an expedition for the full group by foot and an expedition by canoe in smaller numbers. The Gaisce programme can be run alone or as part of one of our tailor-made schooltrips.
