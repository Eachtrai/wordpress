My son had a wonderful experience in Uisce. 
The water sports and the many other activities were his high point as he was able to immerse himself in Irish in a very unique and inclusive way. 
His experience there has helped his oral and aural Irish so much that he went up in grades and his teacher saw a marked improvement. 
Naturally we are booking again for 2017!

Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil libh tar éis an turas iontach a bhí againn an tseachtain seo chaite.
Bhí tréimhse dochreidte againn. Idir na gníomhaíochtaí, an bia agus an teanga, ní dhéanfaidh siad (nó mise) dearmad air!
Ach an rud a sheasann amach i ndáiríre ná an foireann. Caithfidh mé a rá nar fhreastail mé riamh ar ionad ina bhfuil an foireann chomh proifisiúnta, eagraithe, cairdiúil, cabhrasach agus pearsantach, idir Marcus agus na teagascóirí eile, Morris sa chistin agus gach duine eile sna hoifigí a thug cabhair dúinn leis na rudaí 'beaga'...torthaí, an dochtúir &srl.
Feicfimid sibh an bhliain seo chugainn. Míle míle buíochas,Liam.

I am writing again to thank you all for the work you do @uisce. My son attended the leaders course on the bank holiday weekend and had an amazing time - he came back buzzing about the place, the people &amp; the language. I  hope that he remembered his manners &amp; thanked you guys personally before he left. I just wanted to let you know that from this parents perspective, Uisce has had a hugely positive impact on his language skills and more generally it has put an extra spring in his step - so well done to all Míle Buíochas <em>John Maughan</em>

This Easter my 13 year old daughter Niamh Keegan attended a course Colaiste Uisce.  I cannot thank the teachers, staff, chef & every person involved in the running of the course enough, can you please pass on a great big THANK YOU to everyone. We have travelled to many countries around the world & according to Niamh nothing compared to the fun element she had in Uisce in Belmullet. We asked her what did she prefer, Cancun in Mexico or Uisce and you guys won hands down (what can I say!!!!)  Maria Moran

Compared to other centres we have visited over the years, UISCE is certainly way ahead in terms of accommodation, food (the best we’ve ever had at any centre) and activities.  The ratio of supervisor to student is excellent. I have been part of these trips for the last 25-30 years in school and I have never slept as well as I did in UISCE. As soon as I get back to school, I will be booking for next year.

I've been to Coláiste Uisce 5 times over the course of my teenage years, and I can say nothing but good about it. Each year I came home bursting with self confidence, amazing memories, heaps of new friends and of course a WHOLE new outlook grasp on the Irish language. I passed my Junior certificate AND leaving certificate thanks to Coláiste Uisce, and I'll never forget the overwhelming joy I felt each year I attended. I'm always telling my younger friends to go there because I can honestly say that it not only put my Irish on a whole new level, it changed who I was as a person in the long run. Thanks for making my summers the most enjoyable they've ever been! , <em>Aaron Kelly</em>

Thanks very much for all the help on the Irish. I'm finally able to string sentences together in Irish without much difficulty :D  I feel I know WAAY more Irish after the course (cúrsa D).  My Teachers were brill and taught me loads. The sports were insane. Thanks again :) Slán go foill.. <em>Cait Ní Ghealbhain</em>

Just a note to thank you and your team for looking after Jack and his pals during their recent stay. To a man they LOVED it - loved the watersports, loved the place, loved the people &amp; social life &amp; importantly loved the Irish. The would all have stayed longer if possible. Jack was even inspired to take out his guitar and practice and sing when he returned (something that almost never happened before this) because he thought one of the leaders was very cool. Míle Buíochas duit agus do do fhoireann.<em>John Maughan</em>

My daughter Rebecca returned home from 2 weeks in Uisce yesterday.  I knew the minute she came through the door, happy and healthy that she was after having a fantastic time.   She said all the staff were friendly and supportive.  She loved the wide variety of adventure sports and recreational activities and really enjoyed learning Irish in a fun and friendly environment.  She has made great friends and is hoping to return in Summer 2014. I have no hesitation in recommending Uisce to family and friends and would like to thank everyone involved in making Rebecca's two weeks so memorable. <em>Claire Mulhall</em>

Just a quick email to say thanks to you and all the staff for the wonderful time my two sons, Jack and Callum Hazley had your college.   They enjoyed every moment and already are wanting to go back. A sincere thanks to all the staff for making it such an enjoyable experience and particularly to Caroline. Thank you again. <em>Joan Hazley</em>

To Fidelma, I believe you hosted our son Ruairi  in your home.  Thank you very much, he said it was wonderful and "the food was exquisite"!  He also said it "was the best two weeks of my life". <em>Caitriona </em>

Very happy with the course. We are delighted with the change in our son’s attitude to Irish, not just from an exam point of view but because it is a life skill &amp; their national language. <em>Ger Goan</em>

Academically my son’s Irish improved tremendously and he found the sporting experiences both challenging and rewarding<em> Clare Fallon, Gaillimh</em>

Hannah has been to UISCE twice and the only thing she complains about is having to come home! It has truly given her a love of the Irish language which is no mean feat as her mother is English<em> Kate Reynolds, Loch Gorman</em>

It was Liam’s first time away from home on his own but any fears we had vanished within a day of him arriving there. He had a superb experience <em>Paula Crann, Baile Átha Cliath</em>

Another fantastic trip! From the first minute we have been made feel welcome and the team did a brilliant job looking after all 79 students, both on and off the water. The supervision and standard of instruction were excellent (as always) and we look forward to coming back next year for a tenth time! <em>Jonathan Newsome, Newbridge College</em> 

My son Sean had a ball - he just adored the whole thing. His attitude towards Irish has changed completely - it's now fun and cool - and he's using Irish words without even realising it. We are just thrilled <em>Paula O Sullivan, Cork</em>
