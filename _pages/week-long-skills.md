All courses are run through the medium of Irish, following a syllabus used all over Ireland and will be lead by a trained and qualified Instructor. Each course is carefully designed to provide you with all of the skills and confidence you need to get you out on the water and to get the most out of your time on the UISCE.

Please note that Skills Courses do not involve Irish Classes, you are based either on the water or in the class room for theory (In Irish) all day.

<h4>Sailing</h4>
We use open boats here at UISCE, these are very popular courses as they provide endless fun, Sport Craic agus Spraoi, sailing is an ideal way of getting you afloat. Open top boats are ideal for progression into racing and as they are available in centres across the country so they are easy to access.
<h4>Windsurfing</h4>
This exciting sport combines the best features of surfing and sailing into one sport. It allows you the freedom to perform inverted loops, spinning manoeuvres and jumps that no sailing craft can allow.
<h4>Surfing</h4>
Is surfing only for the brave?! If you would like to try this exciting sport or are already an accomplished surfer would like to learn some skills, tricks and manoeuvres on the back shore of Elly Bay one of Irelands hot surf spots our skills courses is for you.
