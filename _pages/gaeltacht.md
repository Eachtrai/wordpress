Learning Irish is fun at Coláiste UISCE.  We have always had a strong focus on the development of conversational Irish, which we have intertwined with the water sports activity this builds confidence and leadership skills along with developing a vast vocabulary of Irish. Coláiste UISCE is the only Irish College to hold accreditation from the Irish Sailing Association and the Irish Surfing Association. This approval is your guarantee that your child receives the highest standards in relation to Instructor / Pupil ratios 1:6 , Buoyancy Aids, water sports equipment and qualifications of instructors. The aim of our Irish Courses is to get you talking as Gaeilge.  24hr supervision is provided for all our students by a dedicated team of night supervisors, teachers, prefects and Bean an Tís to ensure your child gets the highest standard of care. During our Summer Courses we have the options of Coláiste accommodation for those in our Cuan Eilí centre and Bean an Tí accommodation for students attending our Eachléim centre.
<h2>Gaeilge</h2>
Despite advertising our “Fun” approach to teaching Irish, we take our obligation in relation to the standard of Gaeilge in Coláiste UISCE very seriously.  We employ more supervisory staff per student than any other Irish College in Ireland in order to implement and maintain this standard.  Our principals are dedicated to maintaining and insisting upon a solely Irish language atmosphere at the Coláiste.  We operate a clear and transparent discipline system to ensure all students understand that learning Irish is the primary objective of the course at Coláiste UISCE.
<h2>Our Gaeltacht Courses</h2>
