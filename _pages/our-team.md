At Coláiste UISCE we know that our staff are our most important resource. We employ <strong>more staff per student</strong> than any other Irish College, adventure centre or language college in Ireland to ensure the highest standard of supervision and care for your child.

Coláiste UISCE's team are fully qualified and highly motivated.  We are the only Coláiste in Ireland with a fulltime management team of 15 people.

Most of our teachers and instructors are past pupils who have been selected as a result of their dedication, positive, enthusiastic manner and loyalty to Coláiste UISCE.

Our Ardchinnirí (prefects) are also past students who have excelled in spoken Irish and demonstrated strong leadership qualities.

All our staff attend various training courses to equip them with the skills to work with teenagers and their issues and of course to help them excel with the activities and their Gaeilge.

Our Team play a key role in upholding our motto <strong>'Learning Irish is Fun at Coláiste UISCE'. </strong>This takes dedication commitment and boundless energy on their part.

We are Ireland's only Irish college with national accreditation from the ISA (Irish Sailing Association) and The Irish Surfing Association. Therefore, we can confidently guarantee parents that their child will receive the highest standards both on and off the water during their Gaeltacht course at Coláiste UISCE.
