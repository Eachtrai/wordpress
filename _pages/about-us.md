<h4>What is Coláiste UISCE?</h4>
Coláiste UISCE is a unique activity based Irish Language College and Adventure Centre situated in the heart of Mayo's Gaeltacht, where the teaching of Irish is intertwined with the enjoyable experience of modern exhilarating adventure and water sports. <strong>‘Learning Irish is fun’ </strong>is our motto at Coláiste UISCE. We now have <strong>over 25 years experience </strong>in providing safe, educational and enjoyable Irish and Adventure courses. The teaching of Irish through the thrilling medium of adventure sports helps students develop a  <strong>positive attitude towards learning Irish</strong>.  We believe that changing a childs' attitude towards Irish is the most important step towards learning the language.  As Henry Ford once said;-
<blockquote>If you think you can or if you think you can't – you’re right!</blockquote>
For more information on our unique approach to teaching Irish see our page on <a title="Gaeilge" href="https://uisce.ie/index.php/about-us/gaeilge/">Gaeilge.</a>
<blockquote>Lower Ratios for Maximum Results!</blockquote>
We are extremely proud of our excellent <b>teacher to student ratio of 1:6 during watersports.  </b>The <b>1:6</b> <b>ratio </b>ensures that each student<b> </b>receives quality instruction and personal attention which is unparalleled in any other Irish college.  Outdoors our experienced instructors put into practice what students have learnt in the classroom. Learning Irish and changing students' attitudes is much easier in the outdoor class room.  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-948" src="https://uisce.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/quote_i_hear.gif" alt="I Hear I remeber " width="266" height="114" />
