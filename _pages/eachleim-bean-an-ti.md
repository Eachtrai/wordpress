Uisce has recently opened a second centre in the village of Eachléim, the heart of Gaeltacht Iorras.

This new state of the art facility consists of the following:
<ul>
 	<li>3 classrooms equipped with broadband and multi media facilities</li>
 	<li>indoor sports hall for bad weather activites</li>
 	<li>outdoor basketball and five a side soccer courts</li>
</ul>
<strong>
By selecting this option you are choosing the following:</strong>

<strong>Accommodation</strong>
<strong>Your child be accommodated in a Bean an Tí house.</strong> Our Bean an Tí's provide a 'home away from home' environment for our students. All our Bean an Tí's have been approved by Roinn na Gaeltachta. A Bean an Tí house is particularly recommended if a student is travelling on their own or if this is their first time away from home. If your child has special requirements or is anxious about being away from home for the first time, then we recommend a Bean an Tí as the best option.

<strong>Irish Classes</strong>
Students will attend Irish Classes at our Eachléim centre.

<strong>Watersports</strong>
All watersports will be run from our base in Cuan Eilí.

<strong>Land Activities</strong>
Land activities will take place both in Eachléim and in Cuan Eilí.

<strong>Céilís</strong>
