Your team is the most important asset you have in your business. It is the people working for you that will drive your business forward or hold it back. We at UISCE believe that communication is the key factor in building a successful team and in turn a thriving business.

We offer tailor made team building corporate activity breaks to businesses and third level institutions. These courses are designed to focus your employees to work as a team, improve communication and trust and to instill leadership skills in everyone taking part.

Each activity on the water and on land encourages team players to step up and lead the team to victory, solve problems, trust one another. Our adventure sports require determination, courage, concentration and focus. These skills can be brought back and channeled in the workplace.

Our varied evening activities allow for group mixing, socialising, fun and relaxation.

Our experienced teachers and instructors are trained to integrate these life skills into all activities.

These courses are run from September until May. The duration of each course depends on a groups' individual requirements.
