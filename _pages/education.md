<h2><a href="https://uisce.ie/3625-2/">Is Your Child Ready for the Gaeltacht?</a></h2>
Prior to your child attending one of our courses, we strongly advise that you click the link above and read our important information leaflet, ‘Is Your Child Ready for the Gaeltacht?” This informative leaflet covers a number of issues and gives insightful tips on how to address issues such as homesickness, the Irish Language Rule as well as providing a comprehensive overview of our code of behaviour, course rules, disciplinary procedure and our anti-bullying policy.
<h2><a href="https://uisce.ie/code-of-behaviour-rules-discipline-procedure/">Code of Behaviour Rules and Discipline Procedure</a></h2>
In accordance with the code of Ethics and Good Practice for Children’s Sport from the Irish Sports Council, Coláiste UISCE encourages a positive Irish learning atmosphere where we respect each other’s rights and place emphasis on creating a safe learning environment.

We therefore expect all students to conduct themselves in a positive, well mannered and co-operative manner. In order to achieve the above, students are expected to adhere to the Rules and Disciplinary Procedure of Coláiste UISCE for the duration of the course.

Repetitive non compliance with our rules or serious misconduct will lead to dismissal from Coláiste UISCE. The parent/guardian will be liable for any costs incurred due to a student being dismissed from the Coláiste as a result of misconduct.

In our role acting in loco parentis, it may be necessary to interview/question your child while investigating potential incidents.  Any such investigation will be carried out in accordance with our Code of Discipline.

The full document is available to view <a href="https://uisce.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Code-of-Behaviour-Rules-and-Discipline-Procedure-Oifigi%C3%BAil-2019-2.pdf">here</a> and we strongly recommend that you familiarise yourself with this document before your child attends a course with us.
<h2>RIAIL NA GAEILGE / The Irish Rule</h2>
Caithfidh gach duine iarracht a dhéanamh Gaeilge a labhairt i gconaí.  Students must make a determined effort to speak Irish at all times.  Non compliance of this rule will be dealt with through the Disciplinary Procedure and the Code of Conduct. Repetitive non compliance of the Irish rule may result in dismissal from Coláiste UISCE.
