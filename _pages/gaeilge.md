Gaeilge bheo bhríomhar múinte go hanamúil, go proifisiúnta agus go sábháilte tríd eachtraí ar muir is ar tír’

We understand the importance of the Irish Language for teenagers and parents in modern Ireland as a compulsory subject for the Leaving Cert.  With the oral Irish exam constituting 40% of the overall mark, it is more important than ever that your child is confident in their Irish speaking skills. We aim to change the negative attitude towards the language that a lot of teenagers harbour and get more people <em>ag caint as Gaeilge</em>! In line with the government’s 20 year Irish Language Strategy.

<strong>‘Learning Irish is fun’</strong> is our motto and we now have <strong>over 25 years experience</strong> in providing safe, enjoyable Gaeltacht Irish College and Adventure Centre courses.

Taking Irish out of the classroom and learning through the enjoyable medium of water-sports and adventure activities including sailing, windsurfing, surfing, orienteering, archery and canoeing gives students a new perspective of the language. They see the language as a living language, sometimes for the first time, when they get this unique opportunity of using it in it’s natural Gaeltacht environment.

All our qualified teaching staff are highly motivated and energetic and are trained on the best practice of interactive teaching in the UISCE classroom. Our classrooms are fitted with state-of-the-art Promethean Interactive Whiteboards which compliment and enhance our teaching methodology.

We believe that changing childrens' attitudes towards Irish is the most important step towards learning the language.  As Henry Ford once said <i>“If you think you can or if you think you can't – you’re right!</i>

The teaching of Irish through modern exciting adventure and water sports helps students develop a positive<strong> attitude towards learning Irish.  </strong>

<strong>When learned in a positive, natural environment, students begin to view the language as a positive and natural part of who they are. Gaeilge then becomes “cool”,  more appealing to students and therefore easier to learn.</strong>

Our <strong>Instructor to student ratio of 1:6</strong> ensures that each student<b> </b>receives personal attention which is unparalleled in any other Irish college.  Therefore, at Coláiste UISCE students not only return from the Gaeltacht speaking Irish with increased ease but will have achieved National Qualifications in a number of different water sports.

Our experienced and highly motivated instructors help students to put into practice what they have learnt in the Irish classes and at school.  This is consistent with the “Total Immersion” concept which is regarded as best practice in language learning.
