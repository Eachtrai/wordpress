This is our third level in our Youth Leadership Program. There will be an emphasis on training courses to become an Ardchinnire Sinsearach, a water sport instructor and a Maoirseoir in Coláiste UISCE
<h2>The Role</h2>
Each member of the UISCE team plays a very important role in the running of a course. They are heavily involved in problem solving, supervision and creating a safe environment for all students. Maoirseoirí, Ardchinnirí Sinsearacha and Teagascóirí have a central role in helping the course principal run a successful course. They must ensure students are disciplined and that a high standard of Irish is maintained around the centre at all times.
