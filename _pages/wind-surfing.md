Windsurfing is one of our most popular sports at UISCE. Beginners can take advantage of sheltered Monaghan’s Cove until they feel confident enough to sail in the adjacent Elly Bay. The bay's horseshoe shape makes it ideal to sail in whatever the wind direction. On the other side of the peninsula, minutes from UISCE, there are perfect conditions to attract advanced windsurfers. The rolling waves of the Atlantic and consistent winds have attracted competitors throughout Ireland for the final of the National Wavesailing Championships.

This exciting sport combines the best features of surfing and sailing into one sport. It allows you the freedom to perform inverted loops, spinning manoeuvres and jumps that no sailing craft can allow.

<strong>Equipment</strong>

Our equipment is top of the range and in top condition with everything replaced every two years at most!

We currently have 36 modern wide-style beginner boards from 180 litres to 205 litres, wide and steady to help find your feet and start sailing. Improvers can quickly progress to our range of smaller faster boards (90 – 130 litres). Our sails range from beginner sails 2.0m to 5m, to improver and advanced wave and flat water sails from 3.7m to 5.7 m.
