The shelter of Elly Bay is the perfect location to learn how to sail. Our sailing instructors are accredited by the Irish Sailing Association. We offer all levels of training on the water and certify students with ISA certificates based on their level: Taste of Sailing, Start Sailing, Basic Skills and Improving Skills. We follow the syllabi of the ISA and adhere to their high safety and teaching standards.

Returning students may build on skills they learned the previous year and get their log books stamped by our Senior Instructor.

We use a mix of Picos, Funboats, Vision, Bahia and DART 16 here at UISCE which ensure a quick progression in learning and more options in performance range. These are readily available in centres throughout Ireland so students can continue their learning at home.

We maintain a strict ratio of 1:6 in our sailing classes as recommended by the Irish Sailing Association. Our practical sessions are supplemented by sessions ashore focusing on rigging and de-rigging, rope work and safety on the water.Â  To book a place on the Sailing course click <a href="https://bookings.uisce.ie/training">here</a>
