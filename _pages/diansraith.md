The <strong>Diansraith/Intensive Irish Stream</strong> is a specially tailored course designed to leave those in Junior Cert or Leaving Cert years brimming with confidence for the Irish exams.
<strong>Available on:</strong> Cúrsa Cásca and Cúrsa E only
<h2>Intensive Irish Exam Stream</h2>
Having spent over 25 years running our Summer Courses, in response to the needs of you our loyal customers, we are now pleased to offer you the opportunity to attend a first rate <strong>Intensive Irish Stream (Diansraith)</strong> which has been designed to cater for the needs of all exam students.
<blockquote>If your primary objective is to focus on improving your exam results and reducing your exam stress levels, this is the course for you!</blockquote>
<h2>What is the Diansraith?</h2>
Classes are divided to cater for the specific needs of Leaving Cert and Junior Cert honours and ordinary level students on these courses. UISCE has achieved the ideal balance between intensive classroom work and energising adventure activities. It is the perfect positive environment for students to excel and prepare for their oral and aural Irish examinations. Our aim is to maximise your results by giving you specific techniques and a structured approach to your exam. Students of all levels will be catered for on the Diansraith.
<h2>Maximise Your Results</h2>
We have listened to our students for over 25 years. We understand the help they need in national examinations. With <strong>40% of the Leaving Certificate total based on the standard of spoken Irish</strong> and the new Junior Cert cycle focused on continuous assessments on written, spoken and listening skills, the Diansraith is tailored to help students succeed. Having consulted with practicing examiners, we have tailored our syllabus to hone in on the specific skills students need to <strong>achieve top marks in their exams</strong> at both junior and senior level.
<h2>Oral Exam Preparation &amp; Feedback</h2>
Students will be immersed in the Irish language throughout their stay at Coláiste UISCE. They will converse in Irish on the water, in the classroom and during all other activities. Our aim is to make the language more accessible for students and create a natural environment to use the Irish that they have learned both here and at school. There will be oral examination preparation and <strong>feedback throughout the course.</strong> Although the Oral Irish Examination is optional for Junior Certificate students in 2014 teachers will prepare all students for future oral exams. This will be a huge benefit to them entering the senior cycle.

<strong>Students will receive an exam focused workbook which they can revisit at home. Teachers will give students a personal written feedback report with advice on what they need to focus on.</strong>
