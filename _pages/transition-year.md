We at UISCE understand that bringing students away on a Transition Year Trip can be hard work for teachers. We aim to make your trip as hassle-free as possible, from the initial consultation right down to getting the students into bed at night. We will work with you to tailor-make the ideal school trip that suits both your requirements and your budget! UISCE is the ideal location for your Transition Year Trip. We continuously deliver fun and interactive courses in a practical learning environment.<img class=" wp-image-720 alignright" src="https://uisce.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/143989945614167-300x200.jpg" alt="Dreapadóireacht" width="270" height="180" /> Outdoor education paves the way for “learning outcomes” that simply cannot be achieved in the traditional setting of the classroom. Activities help students take greater responsibility for their own learning and decision making. Stronger relationships can develop during your transition year trip. These relationships develop through shared experiences and can break down any barriers that might have previously existed. All transition year trips combine water and land based adventure activities, environmental education, ranganna Gaeilge and life skills coaching. All activities take place in a positive learning environment. 'Learning Irish is Fun' is our motto and the key element to outdoor education. There is an option of achieving nationally recognised certificates from the Irish Sailing, Windsurfing and Surfing Associations.
<blockquote>The Adventure activities bring the language to life and encourages young speakers to find their voice beyond the safety net of English</blockquote>

<h2>Gaeltacht Language Trip</h2>
You can tailor your Transition Year Trip to suit your own requirements. We can fully immerse students in the Irish language or gently introduce them to an atmosphere Gaelach. All watersports, outdoor activities, climbing, evening activities and céilis are on offer through the medium of Irish. We would love to customise a program for your school tour. We have created a natural learning environment where students can practise the Gaeilge that they have learned at school throughout the day. At UISCE we encourage students to increase their vocabulary, ask questions and converse with their peers on and off the water 'As Gaeilge'. For some the draw will be the adventure sports, for others it will be the language, but there will be something for everyone during your language trip to UISCE!
<h2>GAISCE Programmes</h2>
UISCE assists young people to achieve their 'Gaisce Presidents Award' by facilitating the “Adventure Journey Challenge".  UISCE can offer an expedition for the full group by foot and an expedition by canoe in smaller numbers. The Gaisce programme can be run alone or as part of one of our tailor-made schooltrips.
